# pig-scripts

Pig scripts to analyze the billion triples dataset from the Semantic Web (https://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2010/) using AWS Elastic MapReduce and S3.  The dataset comprises a large graph where nodes represent webpages and edges represent links between pages.  Each line represents an RDF triple (or quad in some cases) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Triples).
